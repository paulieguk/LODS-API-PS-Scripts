##the IP Address with a FQDN name in GoDaddy.

$api_key = @{'Authorization' = 'sso-key @lab.Variable(SSO-Key)'}
$baseURL = 'https://api.godaddy.com/v1/domains/<DomainName>'

$labInstanceID = '@lab.LabInstance.Id'

## Get the lab instance Public IP Address
$PIP = (Invoke-WebRequest -uri "http://ifconfig.me/ip").Content
